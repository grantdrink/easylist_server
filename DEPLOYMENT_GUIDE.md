# ðŸš€ EasyList Server Deployment Guide

## Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### 1. Deploy the Server to Railway

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd /Users/grantdrinkwater/Desktop/EasyList_Server

# Install Railway CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize new Railway project
railway init

# Deploy the server
railway up
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway

Go to your Railway dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
VITE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
VITE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret  
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Get Your Server URL

Railway will provide a URL like: `https://easylist-server-production.up.railway.app`

**Save this URL - you'll need it for the next steps!**

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration

In your EasyList frontend, update the server URL:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /Users/grantdrinkwater/Desktop/EasyList

# Add environment variable for your frontend
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-server-url.railway.app" >> .env.local
```

Or manually edit `/src/config/server.js`:
```javascript
API_BASE_URL: 'https://your-actual-server-url.railway.app',
```

### 5. Configure Stripe Webhook

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set endpoint URL: `https://your-server-url.railway.app/api/stripe-webhook`
4. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret and add it to Railway environment variables

### 6. Update Stripe Payment Link

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard â†’ Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links)
2. Find your payment link
3. Set **Success URL**: `https://shotgunly.com/payment-success`
4. Set **Cancel URL**: `https://shotgunly.com/`

### 7. Test the Complete Flow

1. **Test Server Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-server-url.railway.app/api/health
   ```

2. **Complete a Test Payment**:
   - Go to your app at shotgunly.com
   - Sign in with a test email
   - Click "Start 30-Day Free Trial"
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

3. **Verify Webhook Activation**:
   - Should redirect to payment-success page
   - Should automatically activate subscription
   - Check Railway logs for webhook events

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Server Not Responding
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Test health endpoint

### Webhook Not Working
- Check Stripe webhook logs
- Verify webhook URL and signing secret
- Check Railway server logs for errors

### CORS Issues
- Server is configured to allow shotgunly.com
- If using different domain, update CORS settings in server.js

### Environment Variables Missing
- Check `/api/health` endpoint for environment status
- Verify all required variables are set in Railway

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

After deployment:
1. âœ… Server running on Railway
2. âœ… Webhook receiving Stripe events  
3. âœ… Subscriptions activating automatically
4. âœ… Frontend communicating with server
5. âœ… Complete payment flow working

**Your Stripe integration will now work properly with webhook support!**
